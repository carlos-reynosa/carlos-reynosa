### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

MY BACKGROUND
===
My name is Carlos Reynosa and Iâ€™m a passionate and technically curious software engineer from Southern California. I have a B.S. in Computer Science, a M.S. in Software Engineering, and a passion for developing creative technical solutions for the web. My work as an engineer includes experiences as a back and front-end web developer within high visibility university department websites, startup web applications, and e-commerce companies.

WHAT DRIVES ME
===
There are three things that drive me as an engineer. The first is my curiosity for new technologies and their potential to improve the way we work and the solutions we create. The second is my belief that focusing on quality allows software development to be more creative and enjoyable. The last driver is the excitement of new technical challenges and the opportunities they present to be creative in the ways we perceive or solve a problems.
